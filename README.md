 Photometric Comparison Tools

This repository contains Python scripts to plot figures that are presented in [Ho et al. 2021, MNRAS](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/502/1/140/6122898?login=false). The visualizations include scatter plots, confidence contours, and histograms for residual analysis, as well as filter transmission curves.

## Features

- Compare HSC with Maidanak and MEGACAM photometry
- WCS-aware FITS image mosaics with source overlays
- Plot HSC filter transmission curves
- 2D histogram-based contour plotting with confidence levels

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/photometry-comparison.git
